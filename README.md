# Aerial Object Classification & Detection

**Project Title:** Aerial Object Classification & Detection

**Domain:** Aerial Surveillance, Wildlife Monitoring, Security & Defense Applications

**ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Business Use Cases:**

1. Wildlife Protection
   
â—‹ Detect birds near wind farms or airports to prevent accidents.

2. Security & Defense Surveillance
   
â—‹ Identify drones in restricted airspace for timely alerts.

3. Airport Bird-Strike Prevention
   
â—‹ Monitor runway zones for bird activity.

4. Environmental Research
   
â—‹ Track bird populations using aerial footage without misclassification.

**ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow**
